# Serverless Compute with AWS Lambda

## Pre Requisites âœ‹

1. Familiarity with programming languages: You should have a good understanding of at least one programming language such as Python, Node.js.

2. Familiarity with AWS services: You should be familiar with AWS services like IAM, S3, and API Gateway, which can be used in conjunction with Lambda to build serverless architectures.

## Key Results ðŸŽ¯

1. Gain theoretical knowledge of AWS Lambda
   - Understand the key concepts of serverless computing.
   - Understand the main components of AWS Lambda, including functions, event sources, and permissions.
2. Able to create/modify/delete simple Lambda functions using the console, AWS CLI and CloudFormation.
3. Understand and implement Lambda event sources:
   - S3 events.
   - Kinesis streams.
   - DynamoDB streams.
   - API Gateway.
   - CloudWatch events.
   - Custom event sources using AWS SDKs.
4. Implement asynchronous and synchronous invocation of Lambda functions:
   - Understand the differences between invocation types.
   - Implement asynchronous invocation using event sources and SNS.
   - Implement synchronous invocation using API Gateway and SDKs.
5. Understand and implement Lambda function monitoring and logging:
   - Configure CloudWatch Logs for Lambda functions.
   - Use CloudWatch Metrics to monitor Lambda function performance.
6. Understand and implement Lambda function deployment and versioning:
   - Understand the different deployment options for Lambda functions.
7. Understand and implement Lambda function optimization:
   - Use the AWS X-Ray service to troubleshoot and optimize Lambda function performance.
   - Use Lambda Layers to share code and dependencies between Lambda functions.
